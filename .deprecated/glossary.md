# A

## Abstract syntax tree

## Arithmetic shift

A method of multiplication and division by powers of two. Shifting left `n` bits on signed or unsigned is equivalent to `2^n`. 

Note that right shifts are only useful for division with significant caveats.

# B

## Black Box Testing

Tests developed based on _what_ a feature does without knowledge of _how_ it does it.

# C

## Closure

A function value that references variables from outside its body. Essentially the function is 'bound' to the variables.

## Communicating sequential processes

TBD

## Containers as a Service (CaaS)

e.g. Kubernetes, Docker Swarm

- Not quite a PaaS
- Compared to PaaS, an ops team is required, but smaller than it would have been before Docker
- Significantly less cost than PaaS (50-75%) for same computing power and continuous deployment flexibility.

# D

## Decorator

TBD

## Multiplexing

Combining multiple signals (analog or digital) into one signal or a shared medium.

# P

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
---
You push code, it deploys & Manages.

- Reduce Ops team need.
- Example is Heroku.
- Typically built on top of an IaaS offered by another entity - Heroku is on AWS.

Pointer
---
A type of reference where the address of an underlying value is stored. References permit sharing of data resources across processes and eliminate the need to provide expensive copies of large or exceptionally common data.

Note that pointer arithmetic does *not* refer to the manipulation of the values pointed to, rather that it refers to the calculation from one pointer address to the addresses of other - related - data, such as the next item in an array.

# S

## Smoke Testing

A subset of functional and unit tests that exercise core functionality.

## System Testing

Tests paths between sub systems.

# W
 
## White Box Testing

### aka: clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing, structural testing
