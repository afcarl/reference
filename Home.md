These are my personal cribs for various languages and tools. Writing them helps me learn. In many cases the "sources" at the bottom of each page may be a more comprehensive crib or summary than my own.

If you find that the resource I am producing here is more useful, please let me know that and I will strive to do more on that topic and in that manner, as the hope is that these cribs are useful to others.

If you notice something that is inaccurate or incomplete, please open an issue on the autodidact repo.

Thanks!
