Revised December 2015

Thanks for visiting. Several paths may have brought you here:
- Interest in [**code**](https://github.com/michaeldayreads/0_autodidact/wiki/#code) -- _other technologists, prospective employers and collaborators_
- Interest in [**books**](https://github.com/michaeldayreads/0_autodidact/wiki/#bibliophile) -- _book club folks and other bibliophiles_
- Interest in [**writing**](https://github.com/michaeldayreads/0_autodidact/wiki/#writing) -- _those seeking my non code compositions_

## Code
Is how I make my living and is something I am passionate about. As a teen I programmed basic on a commodore 128 and Tandy Pocket Computer 6, only to find a myriad of other interests in college and beyond. It took a few years for those interests to deepen enough to connect back to technology and its place in and impact on society. 

Professionally I work as a member of the web marketing team for a small SaaS company in Boulder, Co. We are a LAMP (PHP) stack and I have worked in the core application in addition to my current duties on the web properties where we use a highly modified WordPress install.

Building tools inspires me, and my efforts outside of the office are focused on application development. I look forward to the next phase in my career being an opportunity as a full stack or back end focused developer. Python is the basin of attraction that holds me most at present.

If you are a prospective employer or collaborator I would welcome hearing from you. The following are updated regularly starting December 2015:
* my [main github profile](https://github.com/michaeldayreads) to see how I code
* this wiki's [Exploring Code](https://github.com/michaeldayreads/0_autodidact/wiki/0-Sources-Exploring-Code) for sources of exercises && my notes in parallel to the code, i.e. show my work
* this wiki's [Code Context](https://github.com/michaeldayreads/0_autodidact/wiki/1-Code-Context-Sources) to grasp _why_ I code - if you are making the world a better place, I would like to help

##Bibliophile
Perhaps you've been to Two Drink Minimum Readers or subscribed to its periodical. Those links now bring you here. 

Or we may have met in person and chatted about a book... or ten. This is actually part of the motivation for this portion of the wiki, you can look over recommendations at your leisure. 

Reading gets me thinking, keeps me inspired, and I value connecting with others about what they read that keeps them inspired and thinking. It ends up here because putting it somewhere is how I get it out of the way of the code I am trying to write.

Bibliophiles are most likely looking for this portion of the wiki:
[Broader Context - aka Bibliography](https://github.com/michaeldayreads/0_autodidact/wiki/a.-Broader-Context)

##Writing
I am grateful and humbled that some of what I write is valued by others. I offer it here. 

The choice to make it a wiki is **very** deliberate. I write to understand, learn and connect with others and having a revision history of what I write is an invitation to compassionate dialogue and an effort to document how I am influenced by and benefit from the engagement of others.

Non code writing can be found here:
