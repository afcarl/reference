# A place for the words, distinct from the code. 
Four flavors of words here.
* Notes from the sources worked with while exploring code.
* Exegesis and commentary on sources that support or motivate my interest in code.
* Exegesis and commentary on sources orthogonal to my interest in code.
* A temporary home for other writing. Eventually this content will migrate to michaeldayreads.com and, well, it needs to live somewhere in the mean time. If I don't write the words, they get in the way when I try to write the code.
