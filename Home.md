## A place for the words, distinct from the code. 
Four flavors of words here. _Comments and feedback on all of it is welcome._ 
* Notes from the sources worked with while exploring code.
* Exegesis and commentary on sources that support or motivate my interest in code.
* Exegesis and commentary on sources orthogonal to my interest in code.
* A temporary home for other writing.

The first two pertain to code, the second two live here until they move to a permanent home. It seems natural to have them live here, they get in the way when I try to code if I don't get them out. Long term michaeldayreads.com will be their home, if you are interested.
