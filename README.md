This project contains reference material for syntax, concepts and context for working as a technologist.

Its primary objective is to assist its author with understanding the material referenced. 

More complete / authoratative references can be found elsewhere and will be cited within the individual documents themselves or within a consolidated SOURCES.md file.

In many cases the content of this project is a revision and reincorporation of documentation found in the sources referenced, and as such the author of this repositiory can be thought of as a contributing editor. 

Please open an issue if you see content that you believe is not properly attributed.
