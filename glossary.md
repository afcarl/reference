## Containers as a Service (CaaS) - Kubernetes, Docker Swarm
- Not quite a PaaS
- Compared to PaaS, an ops team is required, but smaller than it would have been before Docker
- Significantly less cost than PaaS (50-75%) for same computing power and continuous deployment flexibility.

# P

## Platform as a Service (PaaS) - you push code, it deploys & Manages.
- Reduce Ops team need.
- Example is Heroku.
- Typically built on top of an IaaS offered by another entity - Heroku is on AWS.
