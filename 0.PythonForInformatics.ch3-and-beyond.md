# Chapter 3 notes

## Short circuit evaluation

    + SHORT-CIRCUITING + 
    When evaluation of the second part of a logical statement stops  
    due to the first part evaluating as false.
&nbsp;  

    + GUARD PATTERN +
    Code using the presence of a _guard evaluation_ that uses short circuiting to end 
    execution of a series of statements when a value would produce an error.

## Debugging

- In general, error messages indicate where an error was _discovered_.
- Don't forget to check values when tracing an error. The example was an error produced by floor division of integers when float was needed.
