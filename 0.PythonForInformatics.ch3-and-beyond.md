# Chapter 3: Conditional Statements

## Short circuit evaluation

    + SHORT-CIRCUITING + 
    When evaluation of the second part of a logical statement stops  
    due to the first part evaluating as false.
&nbsp;  

    + GUARD PATTERN +
    Code using the presence of a _guard evaluation_ that uses short circuiting to end 
    execution of a series of statements when a value would produce an error.

## Debugging

- In general, error messages indicate where an error was _discovered_.
- Don't forget to check values when tracing an error. The example was an error produced by floor division of integers when float was needed. 

# Chapter 4: Functions

>p.44 "You should treat the names of built in functions as reserved words ..." _but python allows you to assign the name of a built in function to another object. Doing so can produce errors but is not, itself, an error. See **Python Epiphanies**._

We can use any kind of expression as an argument when calling a function.

    + VOID FUNCTION + Functions that perform an action but do not return a value.

# Chapter 5: Iterations

>p. 59 "This way of writing while loops is common because you can check the condition anywhere in the loop (not just at the top) and you can express the stop condition affirmatively (“stop when this happens”) rather than negatively (“keep going until that happens.”)." _This in reference to the pattern of having a "while true" loop with a break in it._

Debugging by bisection - check the value in the middle. If correct, problem in the second half, if incorrect problem in the first.
