#### git

_All working directories are full repositories_


`init` Create an empty git repository or re-initialize an existing one. Running in an existing repository is safe, nothing is overwritten, though the command can be used to move to another location. When this is done, a text file with the new path is placed in the current directory as a symbolic link to the new location.

`add` Add contents (files) to the index (snapshot of the working tree) staging them for the next commit. Only changes to the time of the add will be part of a commit. Further changes have to be added again.

`status` Displays path differences between index and HEAD commit.
