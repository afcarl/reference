Revised December 2015

Thanks for visiting. Several paths may have brought you here. Pick one to start or read through them all:
- An interest in [**Code**](https://github.com/michaeldayreads/0_autodidact/wiki/ii.0-Overview-of-the-wiki#code) -- _other technologists, prospective employers and collaborators_
- A fellow [**bibliophile**](https://github.com/michaeldayreads/0_autodidact/wiki/ii.0-Overview-of-the-wiki#bibliophile) -- _we likely spoke about books_
- Original [**writing**](https://github.com/michaeldayreads/0_autodidact/wiki/ii.0-Overview-of-the-wiki#writing) -- _if you have an interest in non code writing I've done_

## Code
Is how I make my living and is something I am passionate about. As a teen I programmed basic on a commodore 128 and Tandy Pocket Computer 6, only to find a myriad of other interests in college and beyond. It took a few years for those interests to deepen enough to connect back to technology and its place in and impact on society. 

Professionally I work as a member of the web marketing team for a small SaaS company in Boulder, Co. We are a LAMP stack and I have worked some in the core app in addition to my current focus on the web properties.

Building tools inspires me, and my efforts outside of the office are focused on application development. I look forward to the next phase in my career being an opportunity as a full stack or backend focused dev. Python is the basin of attraction that holds me most at present.

If you are a prospective employer or collaborator I would welcome hearing from you. The following are updated regularly starting December 2015:
* my [main github profile](https://github.com/michaeldayreads) to see how I code
* this wiki's [Exploring Code](https://github.com/michaeldayreads/0_autodidact/wiki/0-Sources-Exploring-Code) to see how I am working to improve my skill set
* this wiki's [Code Context](https://github.com/michaeldayreads/0_autodidact/wiki/1-Code-Context-Sources) to grasp _why_ I code - if you are making the world a better place, I would like to help

##Bibliophile
Perhaps you've been to Two Drink Minimum Readers or subscribed to its periodical. Those links now bring you here. 

Or we may have met in person and chatted about a book... or ten. This is actually part of the motivation for this portion of the wiki, you can look over recommendations at your leisure. 

In any case, this content is an attempt to provide something of value from the time I have and do spend reading, which is considerable. It gets me thinking, keeps me inspired, and I value connecting with others about what they read that keeps them inspired and thinking. It ends up here because putting it somewhere is how I get it out of the way of the code I am trying to write.

Bibliophiles are most likely looking for this portion of the wiki:
[Broader Context - aka Bibliography](https://github.com/michaeldayreads/0_autodidact/wiki/a.-Broader-Context)

##Writing
I am grateful and humbled that some of what I write is valued by others. I offer it here. 

The choice to make it a wiki is **very** deliberate. I write to understand, learn and connect with others and having a revision history of what I write is an invitation to compassionate dialogue and an effort to document how I am influenced by and benefit from the engagement of others.
