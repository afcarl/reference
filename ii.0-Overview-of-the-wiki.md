Revised December 2015

Thanks for visiting. Several paths may have brought you here. Pick one to start or read through them all:
- An interest in **Code / Programming** _other technologists, prospective employers and collaborators_
- A fellow **bibliophile** _we likely spoke about books_
- General curiosity - _folks curious about non code writing I've done_

## Code
Is how I make my living and is something I am passionate about. As a teen I programmed basic on a commodore 128 and Tandy Pocket Computer 6, only to find a myriad of other interests in college and beyond. It took a few years for those interests to deepen enough to connect back to technology and its place in and impact on society. Professionally I work as a member of the web marketing team for a small SaaS company in Boulder, Co. Building tools inspires me, and my efforts outside of the office are focused on application development.

If you are a prospective employer or collaborator I would welcome hearing from you. The following are updated regularly:
* my [main github profile](https://github.com/michaeldayreads) to see how I code
* this wiki's [Exploring Code](https://github.com/michaeldayreads/0_autodidact/wiki/0-Sources-Exploring-Code) to see how I am working to improve my skill set
* this wiki's [Code Context](https://github.com/michaeldayreads/0_autodidact/wiki/1-Code-Context-Sources) to grasp _why_ I code - if you are making the world a better place, I would like to help
