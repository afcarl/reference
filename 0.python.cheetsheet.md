#lists

format

    >>> examples = ['a',2.0,['b','c']]

Lists are mutable, unlike strings.

Access by index:

    >>> examples[1]
    2.0

or, use a negative index to start at the end

    >>> examples[-0]
    'a'

Lists may be traversed

    for example in examples:
      print example

Traversing an empty list produces neither a result nor an error

Concatenate lists using +

Repeat lists using *

Slice lists using [_start_:_stop_] : if either _start_ or _stop_ is omitted the beginning or end of the list is used.

Slice can also be used to update the list

    >>> examples[1:] = ['b','c']
    >>> examples
    ['a','b','c',]

_append_ to the list using

    >>> examples.append('d')
    >>> examples
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

Be mindful to create a true copy using the slice method rather than simple assignment, since this simply extends the namespace without adding an object.

    >>> another = example
    >>> another is example
    True

vs

    >>> another = example[:]
    >>> another is example
    False

_extend_ modifies the list the method is applied to by adding the list passed as argument. The argument remains unmodified. Contrast this with concatenation which would leave both arguments unmodified (unless an argument is also being assigned)

`>>> examples`
`['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`
`>>> another = ['e','f']`
`>>> examples.extend(another)`
`>>> examples`
`['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']`
