#lists

format

    >>> examples = ['a',2.0,['b','c']]

Lists are mutable, unlike strings.

Access by index:

    >>> examples[1]
    2.0

or, use a negative index to start at the end

    >>> examples[-0]
    'a'

Check if a list contains a value using _in_

    >>> 'a' in examples
    True

Lists may be traversed

    for example in examples:
      print example

Traversing an empty list produces neither a result nor an error

Concatenate lists using +

Repeat lists using *

Slice lists using [_start_:_stop_] : if either _start_ or _stop_ is omitted the beginning or end of the list is used.

Slice can also be used to update the list

    >>> examples[1:] = ['b','c']
    >>> examples
    ['a','b','c',]

_append_ to the list using

    >>> examples.append('d')
    >>> examples
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

Be mindful to create a true copy using the slice method rather than simple assignment, since this simply extends the namespace without adding an object.

    >>> another = example
    >>> another is example
    True

vs

    >>> another = example[:]
    >>> another is example
    False

_extend_ modifies the list the method is applied to by adding the list passed as argument. The argument remains unmodified. Contrast this with concatenation which would leave both arguments unmodified (unless an argument is also being assigned)

    >>> examples
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    >>> another = ['e','f']
    >>> examples.extend(another)
    >>> examples
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']

_sort_ is a void method that directly modifies the list and returns `None` as the result. 

correct

    >>> examples = ['b','a','c']
    >>> examples.sort()
    >>> examples
    ['a', 'b', 'c']

incorrect

    >>> examples = ['b','a','c']
    >>> examples = examples.sort()
    >>> examples
    >>> 

_pop_ pulls that element from the list by *index* and returns it. Indexing may be used to pop from any location in the list. If the item is not assigned, the item is lost.

_remove_ pulls the item from the list by *value*

>And it seems to do so by memory address, as the last item added to the list is the one removed when there is more than one match.

Useful built in functions for lists include: _len() max() sum() min()_. Of course, _sum()_ requires numerical values in the list.
