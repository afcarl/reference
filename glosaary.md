#### **Reentrancy**  /  **Reentrant**


> A program or subroutine is called reentrant if it can be interrupted in the middle of its execution and then safely called again before its previous invocations complete execution... Once the reentered invocation completes, the previous invocations resume.  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrancy_(computing))

Not the same as idempotent.

Functions can be thread-safe and not reentrant.
